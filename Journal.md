 An issue I am already running across is that GitHub has no autocorrect. This is a big deal to me due to my dyslexia. A way I will go about this problem is by typing in Word first, Then pasting into GitHub.

 First problem i have ran into is that Directly importing a model in from blender to Unity, There are missing walls. A way I have found to fix this is by researching into the sitation and finding out Unity does not show/render backwards faces. To fix this, i have returned to Bldender and reflipped the faces so that they are facing the right way


Another issue i have ran across in the main roation of the maze, is that, in the spectator, I struggled to identify What way it would rotate in each Axis. After trail and error, I worked out it spins orazontally on the Z axis. This has been noted for future referance. 




I ran into several errors in my look code. With these two errors on going, the program will not work 

How I fixed it:
I looked through the code along with a friend. The error was then located and realized. There were some missing capital errors. With these fixed, It now works.
