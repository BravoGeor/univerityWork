 First problem i have ran into is that Directly importing a model in from blender to Unity, There are missing walls. A way I have found to fix this is by researching into the sitation and finding out Unity does not show/render backwards faces. To fix this, i have returned to Bldender and reflipped the faces so that they are facing the right way


Another issue i have ran across in the main roation of the maze, is that, in the spectator, I struggled to identify What way it would rotate in each Axis. After trail and error, I worked out it spins orazontally on the Z axis. This has been noted for future referance.
